@title Export feeds to OPML
@template nnw6mac_en.html

Your subscription list is portable, so you can easily switch to another app or service at any time. NetNewsWire can save an OPML file containing all your subscriptions for you to use with another app or service.

OPML is a widely supported *open* format that’s effectively the standard for sharing feed subscription lists.

1. From the menu bar, choose File › Export Subscriptions….
2. If you have multiple accounts, select which account’s subscriptions will be exported.
3. Choose the name and location for the OPML file.
4. Click Export OPML.

Your subscriptions in NetNewsWire aren’t affected.
