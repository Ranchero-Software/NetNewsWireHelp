NetNewsWire is a free and open source RSS reader for Mac, iPhone, and iPad.

It’s like podcasts — but for reading.

NetNewsWire shows you articles from your favorite blogs and news sites and keeps track of what you’ve read.

This means you can stop going from page to page in your browser looking for new articles to read. Do it the easy way instead: let NetNewsWire bring you the news.

To get started, [download NetNewsWire 6 for Mac](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/releases/download/mac-6.0beta1/NetNewsWire6.0.zip).



## Add an account

<span class="badge-note-small">Tip</span> If you’ll read on one Mac only, you don’t need to add an account.

You can use your syncing feed account so you can keep track of your feeds and the articles you’ve read in one place:

		<li>Choose iCloud or, if you use another service, choose it and sign in.</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<div class="column-right">
