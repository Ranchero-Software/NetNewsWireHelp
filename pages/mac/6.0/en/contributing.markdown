NetNewsWire is open-source and contributions from the community are welcomed.

There are two channels for contributing:

* [Slack][] to discuss the app and work around it.
* [GitHub][nnw-git] to file bugs or feature requests, and to contribute code or documentation.

Every community member is expected to abide by the code of conduct included in the [NetNewsWire Contributing][contrib] page.


Slack
-----

[Join the Slack group][slack] to talk with other NetNewsWire users – and to help out, if you’d like. You can help by testing, coding, writing, providing feedback, or just helping us think things through. Everybody is welcome and encouraged to join.


GitHub
------

The [NetNewsWire project on GitHub][nnw-git] is the place to raise formal issues like bugs and feature requests. If you want to make contributions to NetNewsWire’s code or documentation, please refer to our [contribution guidelines][contrib] page on GitHub.
