@template nnw5mac_en.html

NetNewsWire is a free and open source RSS reader for Mac, iPhone, and iPad.

It’s like podcasts — but for reading.

NetNewsWire shows you articles from your favorite blogs and news sites and keeps track of what you’ve read.

This means you can stop going from page to page in your browser looking for new articles to read. Do it the easy way instead: let NetNewsWire bring you the news.

To get started, [download NetNewsWire for Mac](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/releases/download/mac-6.0/NetNewsWire6.0.zip). <!-- TODO get NetNewsWire 6 link -->

### If you use NetNewsWire only on your Mac

If you’re going to read on only one device, you don’t need to set up an account. Use the built-in On My Mac account. If you change your mind, you can [add an account later](add-an-account).


## Read articles

NetNewsWire comes with a selection of feeds to get you started. If you’re already using a feed aggregator, like BazQux, Feedbin, Feedly, Inoreader, NewsBlur, The Old Reader, or FreshRSS, [add your account](add-an-account).

Click a site in the sidebar to see its articles. Click one and start reading.

### Browse with your keyboard

Press **space bar** to scroll through the article and, when you’ve reached the end, go to the next unread one. If you’re not going to read it or press **n** to go to the next one immediately.

If the full article doesn’t appear in NetNewsWire, click <img src="../../../images/ios-icon-reader_view.png" alt="the Reader View icon" class="ios-inline-button" /> or press ⇧⌘R to load it using [Reader View](reader-view).


## Add a feed

Click + and enter the URL for your favorite site or its feed.
