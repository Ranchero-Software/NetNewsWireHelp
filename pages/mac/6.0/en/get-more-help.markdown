@title Get more help with NetNewsWire
@template nnw6mac_en.html

NetNewsWire is open source and made by volunteers. As such, support comes from the community.

Your question might be answered on the [Frequently Asked Questions][faq] page or the project’s [Technotes][tn].

If not, consider joining the [NetNewsWire Slack group][slack]. You can ask questions there — and also help us think things through as we talk about future versions. It’s the home of the NetNewsWire community.

You can also email <brent@ranchero.com>, but this is probably the slowest way to get help.
