@title Add feeds in Safari using the Subscribe to Feed extension
@template nnw6mac_en.html

You can use the NetNewsWire *Subscribe to Feed* button to [add the feed for a site](adding-feeds) from Safari without copying and pasting the address.

     class="centeredImage"
     style="width: 100%" />

If the Subscribe to Feed button isn’t in the Safari toolbar, turn it on:

1. Open Safari.
2. Choose Safari and then Preferences (⌘,) from the menu bar.
3. Click Extensions, then turn on Subscribe to Feed.

--------

If you can’t click the *Subscribe to Feed* button, it wasn’t able to find any feeds automatically. Not all sites have feeds, but you may be able to find a link to one on the site. Find the RSS, Atom or JSON feed link for the site and [add it to NetNewsWire manually](adding-feeds).

<!--
### If the button opens another app

The *Subscribe to Feed* button will open the default RSS app for your system. This is often Apple News.

You can change the default RSS app from NetNewsWire. Choose **NetNewsWire** › **Preferences…** from the menu bar. In the Preferences window, choose NetNewsWire from the default RSS reader list.
