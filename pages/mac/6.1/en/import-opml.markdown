You can use an OPML subscription list to import your subscriptions from another app or service into NetNewsWire.

To get started, you need an OPML file from your other app or service. Look for the export options.

Then import the feeds in NetNewsWire:

1. Choose File › Import Subscriptions… from the menu bar. If you have more than one account, select the account to add the subscriptions to.
2. Choose the OPML file, then click Open.

When you import subscriptions to an iCloud account, it may take several minutes for the first sync to finish.
