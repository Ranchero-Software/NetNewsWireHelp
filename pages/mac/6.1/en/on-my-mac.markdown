The On My Mac account requires no additional service or software. It’s just you, your subscriptions and NetNewsWire.

With an On My Mac account, NetNewsWire keeps your subscription list and takes care of fetching feeds. It also keeps track of what items you’ve read or not.

On My Mac account information *does not sync* to any other location. If you use more than one Mac or an iOS device, you’ll have to set up feeds and folders on each device yourself.


Refreshing On My Mac feeds
--------------------------

The feeds in the On My Mac account will be refreshed automatically whenever you open NetNewsWire. If left open, NetNewsWire will refresh your feeds every hour, or according to the schedule you set in Preferences.


If you don’t use the On My Mac account
--------------------------------------

If you only use a syncing account with NetNewsWire, you may want to hide or disable the On My Mac account.
