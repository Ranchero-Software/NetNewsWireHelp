@title Use Reader View to get the full text of any article
@template nnw5mac_en.html

Some sites only publish extracts of their full articles. Reader View can fetch the full article text and show it to you in NetNewsWire, so you don’t have to go to another app.

Click <img src="../../../images/mac-icon-reader_view.png" alt="the reader view button" class="mac-inline-toolbar-button" /> in the menu bar to turn it on.
