NetNewsWire can sync your feeds and articles with third-party feed aggregating services like Feedbin and Feedly.

If you use a feed aggregator service, you can keep your read status and subscription list in sync even when you use multiple apps.

If you‚Äôre not using a feed aggregator, you can use the [On My Mac account](on-my-mac).
