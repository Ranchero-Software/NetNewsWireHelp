@title Turn off the unread count in the Dock
@template nnw5mac_en.html

NetNewsWire shows a red badge on its icon whenever you’ve got unread items. If you usually read all your new items (or mark them as read!), the badge lets you know that new articles have arrived. Exciting!

However, if you leave unread items between visits to NetNewsWire, the badge can become distracting, less meaningful, or even stressful. You may find that turning it off is helpful.

Choose **NetNewsWire › Preferences** and turn off **Show unread count**.

Nonetheless, we advocate liberal use of *Mark as Read*. You don’t have to read everything!
