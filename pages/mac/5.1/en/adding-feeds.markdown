@title How to add a feed to NetNewsWire
@template nnw5mac_en.html

NetNewsWire collects items for you from feeds published on websites. To do this, NetNewsWire needs to know the address for the feed. For example: `https://cate.blog/feed/` or `http://mattgemmell.com/atom.xml`

NetNewsWire will try to find the feed’s address for you. All you need to give is the site’s URL, like `cate.blog` or `mattgemmell.com`.

To get started, click the New Feed button on the toolbar, or choose **File › New Feed** (⌘N) from the menu bar.

If you’ve got the address already – great! If NetNewsWire sees something like a URL on the Clipboard, it’ll enter it for you. Otherwise, just type the website’s address into the box.

Before you finish, you can choose an alternative name for the feed and where it will be stored (see below).

Click **Add** and NetNewsWire will fetch the URL you entered. If you entered an address that’s not a feed, NetNewsWire will search the page and add the feed it finds.


Choose a different name for the feed
------------------------------------

Feeds specify their own name, but you may want to change it to something shorter or easier to remember. “Cate” rather than “Accidentally in Code”, for example. You can [rename it anytime later](renaming-feeds), too.


Choose a folder for the feed
----------------------------

Before you add a feed, you can choose the account and folder where you want to save it. 

This is important if you’re using multiple accounts. You can choose to save the subscription to your [On My Mac](on-my-mac) account or a [syncing](syncing-accounts) account, like Feedbin or Feedly.

If you use folders, you can choose which to save the feed in.


What to do when NetNewsWire can’t find a feed
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes NetNewsWire won’t be able to find a feed for a site. Either the site doesn’t offer a feed, or the feed isn’t advertised in a way that NetNewsWire can understand.

Not all sites have feeds, but you may be able to find a link to one on the site. Find an RSS, Atom or JSON feed link for the site and add it to NetNewsWire manually.

Add feeds from Safari using the [NetNewsWire Safari Extension](safari-extension).

If you have an existing OPML subscription list from another app or service, you can [import those feeds into NetNewsWire](import-opml), too.
