When you’re reading an interesting article, you may want to share it with a friend, to your blog, or to a social media account. You can share articles with other apps on your Mac.

To share an article, use the **Share** button on the NetNewsWire toolbar, or Control-click the article in the timeline and choose **Share**. NetNewswire will share information about the article, its URL, title, and content with the other app.

Share with friends and family
-----------------------------

Both the Mail and Messages apps provide share extensions that NetNewsWire can use for sharing. You can even use AirDrop!


Share to blogs and micro blogs
------------------------------

You may want to share what you’ve read – and your thoughts – even wider.

### MarsEdit

For sharing to your WordPress, Blogger and other blogging platforms, you can use [MarsEdit][me]. It’s a sister application to NetNewsWire and we think it’s great. When you share from NetNewsWire, MarsEdit starts a new post pre-filled with the article you were reading.

### Micro.blog

Another app and service we love is [Micro.blog][m.b], a social network built on open web technologies. (Like RSS!)

With the [Micro.blog app][m.b-app], it’s even easier to share and publish your thoughts. The Micro.blog app will start a new post with a Markdown link, ready for you to share.

If the app you want isn’t in the Share menu, you may need to add it.

Click the **Share** button again and choose **More…** to browse the list of available apps in System Preferences. Turn on the app you want, then try again in NetNewsWire.
