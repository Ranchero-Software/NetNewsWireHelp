[The NetNewsWire Privacy Policy](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/privacypolicy)

NetNewsWire has a very strict privacy policy – we don’t want any private information about you.

The only data we collect about how you use NetNewsWire – if you allow – is crash logs.

If you don’t want to share crash logs, choose **NetNewsWire › Preferences…** from the menu bar. Then click **Advanced** and turn off **Send automatically**.

The [full privacy policy](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/blob/master/Technotes/privacypolicy.markdown) is stored in the NetNewsWire GitHub repository, where you can track any changes we might make.
