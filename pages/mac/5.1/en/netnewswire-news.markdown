@template nnw5mac_en.html

The very best way to get news about NetNewsWire is with NetNewsWire itself, using the *NetNewsWire News Feed*. Important and notable news about NetNewsWire will appear there: new version announcements, critical bug notices, tech notes and important project announcements.


Add the NetNewsWire News Feed
-----------------------------

The NetNewsWire News Feed is part of the default subscription list installed the first time you launched NetNewsWire. If it’s no longer in your list, add it back.

From the menu bar, choose **Help › Add NetNewsWire News Feed**. NetNewsWire will open the [New Feed dialog](adding-feeds) pre-filled with the name and address (`https://nnw.ranchero.com/feed.json`). Click **Add**.
