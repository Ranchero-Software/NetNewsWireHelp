When you’re reading an interesting article, you may feel compelled to share it with a friend, to your blog or to a social media account. NetNewsWire works with macOS Share Extensions so you can share articles with other apps on your Mac.

To share an article, use the **Share** button on the NetNewsWire toolbar, or Control-click on the article in the timeline and choose **Share**. Information about the article, its URL, title and content will be passed on to the receiving app.


Sharing with friends and family
-------------------------------

Both the Mail and Messages apps provide share extensions that NetNewsWire can use for sharing. You can even use AirDrop!


Sharing to blogs and micro blogs
--------------------------------

You may want to share what you’ve read – and your thoughts – even wider.

### MarsEdit

For sharing to your WordPress, Blogger and other blogging platforms, you can use [MarsEdit][me]. It’s a sister application to NetNewsWire and we think it’s great. When you share from NetNewsWire, MarsEdit starts a new post pre-filled with the article you were reading.

### Micro.blog

Another app and service we love is [Micro.blog][m.b], a social network built on open web technologies. (Like RSS!)

With the [Micro.blog app][m.b-app], it’s even easier to share and publish your thoughts. The Micro.blog app will start a new post with a Markdown link, ready for you to share.

What if my app isn’t in the Share menu?
---------------------------------------

You may have an app that doesn’t appear in the Share menu. This could be because the app doesn’t provide a share extension. It may do, though!

Click the **Share** button again and choose **More…** to browse the list of available apps in System Preferences. If you find your app, select its checkbox so it will appear in the Share menu, then try again in NetNewsWire.
