NetNewsWire is open-source and contributions from the community are welcomed.

There are two channels for contributing:

* For discussing the app and work around it, we use a [Slack group][slack]
* For filing tickets, and contributing code or documentation, we use [GitHub][nnw-git].

Every community member is expected to abide by the code of conduct included in the [NetNewsWire Contributing][contrib] page.


Slack
-----

[Join the Slack group][slack] to talk with other NetNewsWire users – and to help out, if you’d like to. You can help by testing, coding, writing, providing feedback, or just helping us think things through. Everybody is welcome and encouraged to join.


GitHub
------

The [NetNewsWire project on GitHub][nnw-git] is the place to raise formal issues like bugs and feature requests. If you want to make contributions to NetNewsWire’s code or documentation, please refer to our [contribution guidelines][contrib] page on GitHub.
