NetNewsWire is open source and made by volunteers. As such, support comes from the community.

Your question might be answered on the [Frequently Asked Questions][faq] page or the project’s [Technotes][tn].

If not, consider joining the [NetNewsWire forum](https://discourse.netnewswire.com/). You can ask questions there — and also help us think things through as we talk about future versions. It’s the home of the NetNewsWire community.
