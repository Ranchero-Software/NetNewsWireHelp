@title Renaming feeds and folders
@template nnw5mac_en.html

Each feed publishes a name for their feed. If you want to change it to be more descriptive, shorter, or easier to find, rename it in NetNewsWire.

To change a feed or folderâ€™s name, control-click on the feed or folder in the sidebar and choose **Rename**. Enter the new name and press Return.

You can also choose a different name for a feed when you [add a new feed](adding-feeds).
