NetNewsWire provides a Safari Extension which adds a *Subscribe to Feed* button to your Safari toolbar. With it, you can quickly add a site’s feed without entering an address into NetNewsWire manually.


Turn on the NetNewsWire Safari Extension
-----------------------------------------

The Safari Extension is installed automatically with NetNewsWire. However, it must be turned on before you can use it.

1. Open Safari
2. From the menu bar, choose **Safari** and then **Preferences…** (⌘,)
3. Click the **Extensions** panel in the Preferences window
4. From the list, select the **Subscribe to Feed** extension to turn it on
5. Close the Preferences window

The *Subscribe to Feed* button will be added to your Safari toolbar.

Add a feed using the Safari Extension
-------------------------------------

In Safari, click the *Subscribe to Feed* button. This will open NetNewsWire to the [Add Feed](adding-feeds) dialog. There you can give it an alternative  name and choose the destination account and folder before adding it.

### The button is dimmed

If the *Subscribe to Feed* is dimmed, it wasn’t able to find any feeds automatically. The button will only be turned on for sites that advertise a feed in their code.

You may be able to find a link to a feed by checking the site. There, look for a link to an RSS, Atom or JSON feed. If one exists, you can [add this URL to NetNewsWire directly](adding-feeds.html). Control-click on the link, copy the URL, and paste it into the Add Feed dialog in NetNewsWire.


### The button opens another app

The *Subscribe to Feed* button will open the default RSS app for your system. This is often Apple News.

You can change the default RSS app from NetNewsWire. Choose **NetNewsWire** → **Preferences…** from the menu bar. In the Preferences window, choose NetNewsWire from the default RSS reader list.
