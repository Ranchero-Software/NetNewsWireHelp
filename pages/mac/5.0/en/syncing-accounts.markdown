@title Using syncing accounts with NetNewsWire
@template nnw5mac_en.html

In addition to the [On My Mac account](on-my-mac.html), NetNewsWire can also sync your feeds and articles with third-party feed aggregating services.

If you use a feed aggregator service, you can keep your read status and subscription list in sync even when you use multiple apps.

**Note:** In NetNewsWire 5.0 you can only sync with [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/). We plan to support more services in future versions.
