@template nnw5mac_en.html

You can use an OPML subscription list to import your subscriptions from another app or service into NetNewsWire.

To get started, you need an OPML file from your other app or service. Look for the export options. Then import the feeds in NetNewsWire:

1. Choose **File** → **Import Subscriptions…** from the menu bar. If you have more than one account, select the account to add the subscriptions to.
2. Choose the OPML file, then click **Open**.

Your current subscription list won’t be affected.
