@title How to Get NetNewsWire News
@template page.html

The [NetNewsWire blog](https://netnewswire.blog/) has an [RSS feed](https://netnewswire.blog/feed.xml), which means you can read news about NetNewsWire in NetNewsWire. ðŸ’¥

The NetNewsWire feed is included as one of the default feeds for new users, so thereâ€™s a chance you already have that feed.

But, in case you donâ€™t, itâ€™s easy to add. Copy the following URL and add it as you would any other feed:

[https://netnewswire.blog/feed.xml](https://netnewswire.blog/feed.xml)

Alternately, on Mac, you can pull down the **Help** menu and choose **Add NetNewsWire News Feed**. (If you already have the NetNewsWire news feed, then the menu item is disabled.)

PS The NetNewsWire blog is hosted on [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/).
