@title How to import feeds from other apps with OPML
@template nnw5ios_en.html

You can use an OPML subscription list to import your subscriptions from another app or service into NetNewsWire.


Get an OPML file
----------------

Download an OPML file containing your subscriptions from your current app or service. How to do this will vary depending on the app, though it often appears in the app’s settings. Check the app’s documentation.

If you’re saving the file on an iOS or iPadOS device, save the `.opml` file to a location in the Files app. On a Mac, save the file to iCloud Drive or other syncing service connected to your device.



Add the feeds to NetNewsWire
----------------------------

1. Tap <img src="../../../images/ios-icon-settings.png" alt="the Settings button" class="ios-inline-button-large" /> on the Feeds screen.
2. Tap Import Subscriptions.
3. If you use more than one account, choose which will receive the new subscriptions.
4. Tap on the OPML file from its location in the Files app.

The new feeds will be added to your current subscription list.

After you import the feeds, you can delete the downloaded `.opml` file. If you need a copy later, you can [export your OPML subscription list](export-opml) from NetNewsWire.
