The NetNewsWire timeline is the list of articles for a feed or Smart Feed.

By default, this list displays newer articles at the top.

You can reverse the sorting for the timeline in NetNewsWireâ€™s settings. Tap <img src="../../../images/ios-icon-settings.png" alt="the settings button" class="ios-inline-button-large" /> on the Feeds screen, then turn on Sort Oldest to Newest.

This setting applies to all feeds.
