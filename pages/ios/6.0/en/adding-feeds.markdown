@title How to add a feed to NetNewsWire
@template nnw5ios_en.html


NetNewsWire collects items for you from feeds published on web sites. To do this, it needs to know the address for the feed. For example: `https://cate.blog/feed/` or `http://mattgemmell.com/atom.xml`

*It’s okay if you don’t know that.* NetNewsWire can help you find the address automatically.

When you’re using Safari, tap <img src="../../../images/ios-icon-share.png" alt="" class="ios-inline-button-large" /> to add a feed using the [Share Extension](share-extension).



To add a feed directly in NetNewsWire
-------------------------------------

NetNewsWire will look at any web page and try to find the feed’s address for you. All you need to give is the site’s URL – like `cate.blog` or `mattgemmell.com`. You don’t even need to enter `http://` or `https://` there.

To get started, tap <img src="../../../images/ios-icon-add_feed.png" alt="the Add Feed button" class="ios-inline-button" /> on the Feeds screen.

If you’ve got the address already – great! If NetNewsWire sees something like a URL on the Clipboard, it’ll enter it for you. Otherwise, just type the website’s address into the box.

If you want, you can choose an alternative name for the feed and where to save it.

Tap Add and NetNewsWire will fetch the URL you entered. If you entered an address that’s not a feed, NetNewsWire will search the page and add the feed it finds.



Choose an alternative title for a feed
--------------------------------------

Feeds specify their own title, but you may want to change it to something shorter or easier to remember. “Cate” rather than “Accidentally in Code”, for example. You can [rename it any time later](renaming-feeds), too.



Choose a feed’s folder
----------------------

Before you add a feed, you can choose the account and folder where it will be saved. 

This option is especially important if you’re using multiple accounts. You can choose whether to save the subscription to your [syncing account](syncing-accounts) or a local [On my iPhone or iPad account](on-my-ios-device-account).

In either case, if you use folders, you can also choose which folder to keep the feed in.



If NetNewsWire can’t find a feed
--------------------------------

Sometimes NetNewsWire won’t be able to find a feed for a site. Either the site doesn’t offer a feed, or the feed isn’t advertised in a way that NetNewsWire can understand.

You may be able to find a feed manually by visiting the site. There, look for a link to an RSS, Atom or JSON feed. If one exists, you can add this direct URL to NetNewsWire using the process above. Touch and hold on the link and copy the URL to paste into NetNewsWire.



Import feeds from other services
--------------------------------

If you have an existing OPML subscription list from another app or service, you can [import those feeds into NetNewsWire](import-opml), too.
