@title Using syncing accounts with NetNewsWire
@template nnw5ios_en.html

NetNewsWire can sync your feeds and articles with third-party feed aggregating services like [Feedbin][] and [Feedly][].

Using these services lets you maintain a single subscription list across different apps, platforms, and devices. Article status is also tracked, so your unread and starred articles stay in sync too.

If you‚Äôre not using a feed aggregator, you can use NetNewsWire in local account mode with an [On My iPhone or iPad account](on-my-ios-device-account).

[feedly]: https://feedly.com/i/welcome "Welcome to Feedly"
