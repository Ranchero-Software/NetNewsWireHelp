### Filter the Feeds list

When you turn on the read items filter for the Feeds list, only feeds with unread items will appear.

### Filter Timelines

When you turn on the read items filter in the timeline, you’ll only see items that are unread. The filter only applies to that feed, so you can decide how each feed’s timeline will appear.
