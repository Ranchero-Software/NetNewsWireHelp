[The NetNewsWire Privacy Policy](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/privacypolicy)

NetNewsWire has a very strict privacy policy – we don’t want any private information about you.

The only data we get about how you use NetNewsWire is crash logs – and that’s *only if you agree and opt in*. On iOS and iPadOS these logs are provided to us by Apple’s *Analytics & Improvements* feature.


To opt out of sharing crash logs
--------------------------------

To stop sharing crash reports from your device, open the *Settings* app. Tap Privacy › Analytics & Improvements and turn off Share With App Developers. This setting applies to all third-party apps on your device.


Changes to the Privacy Policy
-----------------------------

The [full privacy policy](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/blob/master/Technotes/privacypolicy.markdown) is stored in the NetNewsWire GitHub repository, where you can track any changes we might make.
