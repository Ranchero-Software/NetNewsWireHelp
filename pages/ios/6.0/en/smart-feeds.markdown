NetNewsWire has *Smart Feeds*, collections of articles built from your subscriptions, based on certain criteria. NetNewsWire offers three of these for you: Today, All Unread, and Starred.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Today Smart Feed will show you articles published in the past day. It’s not strictly “today”, but the past 24 hours or so.

This feed is a great for scanning. You can look through the article titles, images and previews to look for something you definitely want to read.

If you subscribe to news sites, you can quickly get caught up reading through the headlines.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Unread Smart Feed shows you any article that’s unread.

You can use the Unread Smart Feed to quickly clear out all old unread articles. Tap <img src="../../../images/ios-icon-mark_all_read.png" alt="" class="ios-inline-button" /> Mark All as Read if you’re ever feeling stressed about “catching up” on your reading. *You don’t have to read everything!*



<img src="../../../images/ios-icon-starred.png" alt="" class="ios-inline-button" /> Starred
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any article you mark as Starred will appear in this list. Stars can mean anything you want, but you may want to use them for:

- an article you want to read later
- something you liked and might read again
- inspiration for your own future blog (or microblog) post

Tap <img src="../../../images/ios-icon-star.png" alt="" class="ios-inline-button" /> to save an article to the starred list.



Custom Smart Feeds
------------------

In future releases we intend to add the ability to build your own with different criteria.
