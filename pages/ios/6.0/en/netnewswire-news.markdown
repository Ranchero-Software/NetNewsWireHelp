The very best way to get news about NetNewsWire is with NetNewsWire itself, using the *NetNewsWire News Feed*. Important and notable news about NetNewsWire will appear there: app updates, critical bug notices, tech notes and important project announcements.


Add the NetNewsWire News Feed
-----------------------------

The NetNewsWire News Feed is part of the default subscription list that was added when you first launched NetNewsWire. If itâ€™s no longer in your list, add it back.

Tap <img src="../../../images/ios-icon-settings.png" alt="the Settings button" class="ios-inline-button-large" /> on the Feeds screen, then tap Add NetNewsWire News Feed.

NetNewsWire will open the [New Feed screen](adding-feeds) pre-filled with the name and address (`https://nnw.ranchero.com/feed.json`). Tap Add.
