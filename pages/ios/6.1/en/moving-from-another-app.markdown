There are lots of great feed readers. Fortunately, it’s easy to switch amongst them to find the perfect one for you.

NetNewsWire is no different: coming is just as easy as [going](export-opml). Though we hope NetNewsWire is right up your street.



If you use Feedbin or Feedly
----------------------------

You can use your Feedbin or Feedly account directly in NetNewsWire. [Add your account](syncing-accounts) to get started.

Other syncing services aren’t supported yet, but you can still use a local account.



If you use another service, or none at all
------------------------------------------

Moving from one app to another is usually a breeze because subscription lists are commonly shared using an open standard format: OPML.

#### Export your subscription list

How to export your subscription list will vary depending on the app, though it often appears in the app’s settings. Check the app’s documentation. In Reeder, for example, go to Settings, tap on the account, and then tap on *Export as OPML…*.

Save the OPML file to a location in the Files app. Be sure to choose a service like iCloud Drive if you want to use the subscription list on another device.

After you’ve saved the file, open NetNewsWire and [import the OPML file](import-opml). We hope you enjoy using NetNewsWire.
