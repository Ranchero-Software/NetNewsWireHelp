@title Local accounts: On My iPhone and On My iPad
@template nnw61ios_en.html

A local account – *On My iPhone* or *On My iPad* – is the simplest way to use NetNewsWire. Using a local account requires no additional service or software, just NetNewsWire. It’s totally free.

Local accounts don’t sync
-------------------------

On My iPhone and On My iPad account data *does not sync* to any other location. It works best for people who only read NetNewsWire feeds on one device, or want to keep separate subscription lists on different devices. 

If you want everything synced across devices, you can use NetNewsWire with a [syncing service](syncing-accounts) like Feedbin or Feedly, too.



Deactivate the On My iPhone or On My iPad account
-------------------------------------------------

If you only use a syncing account with NetNewsWire, you may want to  deactivate the local account. You can do it in NetNewsWire’s settings, or simply from the Feeds list:

1. Touch and hold the On My iPhone or On My iPad group on the Feeds screen
2. Choose Deactivate from the menu

You’ll no longer see the account in the Feeds list, and its feeds won’t be refreshed.



How local accounts are refreshed
--------------------------------

If you have turned off *Background App Refresh* in System Settings, your feeds will be refreshed when you open the app. Otherwise, NetNewsWire will check for new articles throughout your day and at times you’re likely to open NetNewsWire.
