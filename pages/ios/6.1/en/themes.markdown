@title Manage and Use Article Themes
@template nnw61ios_en.html


Article Themes in NetNewsWire can change how articles are rendered in NetNewsWire. They can change the layout,
colors, fonts, and other attributes of an article. They don't typically change the content of an article.

NetNewsWire includes several Article Themes, but you can add other themes from other users. Make sure that 
the theme ends in `.nnwtheme`. Older versions of NetNewsWire included support for styles which have a different
suffix and are incompatible with new version of NetNewsWire.



Change the Theme
----------------

It is easy to change which theme you are currently using. Just go to Settings and in the Articles section you
can select Theme. It will show you a listing of the currently installed Themes. Select one and then navigate
to an article to view the selected Theme.



Add a Theme Using a URL
------------------------

Themes can be distributed by Theme developers over the web. All they have to do is provide a special link to the Theme.
When the link is clicked NetNewsWire will ask you to confirm if you want to install the Theme. It's that simple!



Add a Theme Manually
---------------------

You may acquire a theme by downloading it, creating it, or having it shared with you. Typically the Theme will be in
a Zip file. Unzip the Theme and move it to an iCloud Drive location that NetNewsWire can access. An example would be
the Downloads folder in iCloud Drive.

In Settings go to Theme and tap <img src="../../../images/ios-icon-add_theme.png" alt="the Add Theme button" class="ios-inline-button" /> on the Theme screen. You can then select the Theme you saved to iCloud Drive and install it.
It should now be available in your list of Themes.



Delete a Theme
--------------

If you want to delete a Theme you can use the standard left-swipe on the Theme to remove it.
