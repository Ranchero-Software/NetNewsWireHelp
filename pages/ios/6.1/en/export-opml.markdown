@title How to export feeds with OPML
@template nnw5ios_en.html

Your subscription list is portable, meaning you can easily switch to another app or service at any time. You can save a file containing all your NetNewsWire subscriptions.

This file is saved in the OPML format. It’s a widely supported *open* format that’s effectively the standard for sharing feed subscription lists.



Export your feeds
-----------------

Your subscriptions will be unaffected by exporting. Nothing is changed or removed.

1. Tap <img src="../../../images/ios-icon-settings.png" alt="the Settings button" class="ios-inline-button-large" /> from the Feeds screen.
2. Tap Export Subscriptions.
3. If you have multiple accounts, choose which account’s subscriptions to export.
4. Choose where to save the file.
