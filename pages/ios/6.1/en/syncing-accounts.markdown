@title Using syncing accounts with NetNewsWire
@template nnw61ios_en.html

NetNewsWire can sync your feeds and articles with third-party feed aggregating services like [Feedbin][] and [Feedly][].

Using these services lets you maintain a single subscription list across different apps, platforms, and devices. Article status is also tracked, so your unread and starred articles stay in sync too.

If you’re not using a feed aggregator, you can use NetNewsWire in local account mode with an [On My iPhone or iPad account](on-my-ios-device-account.html).

[feedly]: https://feedly.com/i/welcome "Welcome to Feedly"



Add a syncing account

You can add a syncing account in NetNewsWire’s Settings.

1. Tap <img src="../../../images/ios-icon-settings.png" alt="the Settings button" class="ios-inline-button-large" /> on the Feeds screen.
2. Tap Add Account, then tap your service.
3. Enter the username and password for your account, or tap Show Passwords to fill in a saved password.
4. Tap Add Account.

NetNewsWire will connect to the service and begin syncing your feeds.

Sync account feeds appear in the Feeds list, after Smart Feeds and On My iPhone/iPad accounts.


Change syncing account information
----------------------------------

### Change the account name

The name of your sync account will be the name of the service by default. You can change this name, which is especially useful if you have multiple accounts on the same service. You can even use emoji. 🐝

Touch and hold on an account in the Feeds list and choose Get Info. Enter the new name and tap Done.


### Update the account credentials

If you change any information for logging into the sync account – user name, email address, password – you may need to update the credentials stored in NetNewsWire.

1. Touch and hold on an account in the Feeds list and choose Get Info.
2. Tap Credentials.
3. Enter your updated login information, or tap Show Passwords to fill it in a saved password.
4. Tap Update Credentials.
